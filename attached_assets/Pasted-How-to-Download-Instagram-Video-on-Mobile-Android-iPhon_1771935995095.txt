How to Download Instagram Video on Mobile (Android & iPhone Guide)

Instagram does not provide a direct download button for videos, so if you want to save a Reel, Story, or feed video to your phone, you’ll need to use an alternative method — and the safest way is using a browser-based Instagram video downloader.
This guide explains exactly how to download Instagram videos on mobile, whether you use Android or iPhone.

How to Download Instagram Video on Android
Many Android users try installing third-party apps, but those apps often add watermarks or require login access, so instead of installing risky apps, you can download Instagram videos safely using your phone’s browser.
Step-by-step:
Open Instagram and find the video.


Tap the share icon and select Copy Link.


Open Chrome (or any browser).


Paste the link into an Instagram video downloader.


Tap Download.


The video will save directly to your gallery.
This method works for:
Reels


Feed videos


IGTV


Public video posts


No app installation needed.

How to Download Instagram Video on iPhone
iPhone users often think downloading is harder because iOS is more restricted, but you can download Instagram videos easily using Safari without installing any app.
Step-by-step:
Open Instagram.


Copy the video link.


Open Safari.


Paste the link into an Instagram video downloader.


Download the video.


The file will save to your Files or Photos app, depending on your iOS settings.
No jailbreak required.


How to Download Instagram Video Without App
Many people search for “how to download Instagram video without app” because apps can contain ads or collect data, and the safest alternative is using a web-based downloader that works directly in your browser.
To do this:
Copy the Instagram video link


Paste it into an online downloader


Download instantly


This works on both Android and iPhone.

How to Download Instagram Video Without Watermark on Mobile
Some download apps add their own branding to the video, but if you use a tool that preserves the original file, you can download Instagram videos without watermark and without quality loss.
Always choose a downloader that:
Keeps original resolution


Preserves audio


Does not rebrand the video



Can You Download Instagram Reels on Mobile?
Instagram recently enabled a Reel download option, but it is not enabled on all reels. However, you can save any Reel by copying the link and pasting it into a downloader that supports Reel format like our Instagram Reels Downloader.
The same method works for:
Instagram Reels


Stories (public)


Feed videos


What About Private Instagram Videos?
Private accounts are protected for privacy reasons, so you can only download private Instagram videos if you are authorized or downloading your own content.
Never attempt to bypass privacy settings.
Is It Safe to Download Instagram Videos on Phone?
Downloading Instagram videos is safe if you avoid suspicious apps and do not share your Instagram password, because secure browser-based tools do not require login access.
Always:
Avoid unknown apps


Do not enter your credentials


Use trusted tools
