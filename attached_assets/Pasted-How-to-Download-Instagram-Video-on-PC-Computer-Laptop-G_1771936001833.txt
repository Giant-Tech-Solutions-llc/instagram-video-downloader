How to Download Instagram Video on PC (Computer & Laptop Guide)

Instagram does not offer a download button for videos on desktop, so if you want to save a Reel or feed video on your computer, you need to use a safe alternative method — and the easiest way is using a browser-based Instagram video downloader.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to download Instagram video on PC step by step, without installing extensions or risky software.

Method 1: Download Instagram Video on PC Using a Browser (Recommended)
Many people install browser extensions to download videos, but extensions often stop working after updates or raise privacy concerns, so the safer solution is using an online Instagram video downloader directly in your browser.
Step-by-step:
Open Instagram in your browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).


Find the video you want to download.


Click the three dots (…) on the post.


Select Copy Link.


Open a trusted Instagram video downloader website.


Paste the link into the input box.


Click Download.


The video will be saved to your computer’s Downloads folder.
This method works for:
Instagram Reels


Feed videos


IGTV videos


Public video posts


No extension required.

Method 2: Download Instagram Video on Laptop Without Software
Many users search for “how to download Instagram video on laptop without software” because installing programs can slow down your system, and the easiest solution is using a web-based downloader that runs entirely in your browser.
To do this:
Copy the Instagram video URL


Paste it into an online downloader


Download instantly


You don’t need to install anything on Windows or Mac.

How to Download Instagram Video Without Watermark on PC
Some tools add watermarks or reduce video quality, but if you use a downloader that preserves the original file, you can download Instagram video without watermark and without losing HD quality.
Always look for tools that:
Keep original resolution


Do not add branding


Preserve audio


This ensures your downloaded video stays clean.

How to Download Instagram Reels on PC
Instagram does not allow direct Reel downloads from other accounts on desktop, but you can download Reels by copying the Reel link and pasting it into a downloader that supports Reel format.
The same steps apply:
Copy the Reel link.


Paste it into the downloader.


Download the file.


Works exactly like feed videos.

Can You Download Instagram Videos from Private Accounts?
Private accounts are protected by Instagram’s privacy system, so you can only download private Instagram videos if you are authorized or downloading your own content.
Never attempt to bypass privacy restrictions.

Is It Safe to Download Instagram Videos on PC?
Downloading Instagram videos on PC is safe if you avoid suspicious extensions and do not enter your Instagram password anywhere, because secure browser-based tools do not require login access.
For safety:
Do not install unknown extensions


Do not share login credentials


Use trusted tools
